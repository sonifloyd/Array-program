# 1) What is Java?
Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991. It can also be known as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.
# 2) What are the differences between C++ and Java?
     C++                                Java

C++ is platform-dependent.              Java is platform-independent.
C++ supports multiple inheritance.      Java doesn't support multiple inheritance.
C++ supports structures and unions.     Java doesn't support structures and unions.
C++ supports both call by value and 
call by reference.                       Java supports call by value only. There is no call by reference in java.
# 3) List the features of Java Programming language.
1) Simple: Java is easy to learn. The syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes easier to write the program in it.

2)Object-Oriented: Java follows the object-oriented paradigm which allows us to maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.

3)Portable: Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) which can be easily run on every machine.

4)Platform Independent: Java is a platform independent programming language. It is different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform to be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed.

5)Secured: Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also provides the concept of ByteCode and Exception handling which makes it more secured.

6)Robust: Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling, etc. make it more robust.
# 4) What do you understand by Java virtual machine?
Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program. JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code.Java interpete the Byte code into machine language.Byte code is independent of any machine or computer.
